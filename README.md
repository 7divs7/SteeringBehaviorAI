# SteeringBehaviorAI
Demonstration of simple autonomous vehicle maneuvering and collision avoidance using a fusion of steering behaviors in Unity 3D.

## A bit on Steering Behaviors
Steering Behaviors are designed to give autonomous characters the ability to navigate around their world in a life-like  and improvisational manner. Rather than involving complex path planning strategies or global calculations, steering behaviors use local information. 

A combination of steering behaviors can  be used to achieve higher level goals. In this project, the following two major steering behaviors have been implemented: 
* Path Following involving Seeking, Arrival and Cruising behaviors
* Obstacle Avoidance 


## Instructions
Open up a new Unity project and import the package file (SteeringBehaviorAI.unitypackage).
